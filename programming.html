    <!-- Program Purpose: This Program contains deffinitions and infomation on Algorithims and Software Testing -->
    
    <h2>Phases of computer program development:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Phase 1: Understand the problem</li>
        <li>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problem</li>
        <li>Phase 3: Write the program code in appropriate language based on the algorithm</li>
        <li>Phase 4: Enter the program and save</li>
        <li>Phase 5: Execute the program</li>
        <li>Phase 6: Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest</li>
        <li>Phase 7: Document and evaluate the program</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Programming structures:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sequential structure: Top-down execution</li>
        <li>Decision structures: if/then/else</li>
        <li>Iterative (Looping):
            <ul>
                <li>while loop: continue looping as long something is true</li>
                <li>repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is true</li>
                <li>for loop: loop a given number of times</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recursive structures:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself</li>
        <li>Repetition continues until:
            <p>Degenerative case, which is a termination condition, is met
            (degenerative case is also called a "base case")</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Two classic programming/database problems</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sorting:
            <ul>
                <li>Sorting numbers</li>
                <li>Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Searching: find specific data that meet certain criteria</li>
        <li>In database:
            <ul>
                <li>Filters: temporary search</li>
                <li>Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Two popular search techniques:
            <ul>
                <li>Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time</li>
                <li>Binary search:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Only works if data is SORTED first</li>
                        <li>Start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Two classic program goals:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Efficiency: Program takes minimal time and/or resources</li>
        <li>Correctness: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Software testing and verification</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Kinds of tests:
            <ul>
                <li>Acceptance testing: Verifying whether the whole system works as intended </li>
                <li>Integration testing: Ensuring that software components or functions operate together </li>
                <li>Unit testing:Validating that each software unit runs as expected. A unit is the smallest testable component of an application  </li>
                <li>Functional testing:  Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements. Black-box testing is a common way to verify functions</li>
                <li>Performance testing:Testing how the software runs under different workloads. Load testing, for example, is used to evaluate performance under real-life load conditions</li>
                <li>Regression testing: Checking whether new features break or degrade functionality. Sanity testing can be used to verify menus, functions and commands at the surface level, when there is no time for a full regression test</li>
                <li>Stress testing: Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails. Stress testing is considered to be a type of non-functional testing</li>
                <li>Usability testing:Validating how well a customer can use a system or web application to complete a task</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Software testing is done to detect:
            <ul>
                <li>Architectural flaws</li>
                <li>Poor design decisions</li>
                <li>Invalid or incorrect functionality</li>
                <li>Security vulnerabilities</li>
                <li>Scalability issues</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Testing best practices:
            <ul>
                <li>Continuous testing</li>
                <li>Configuration management</li>
                <li>Service virtualization</li>
                <li>Defect or "bug tracking"</li>
                <li>Metrics and reporting</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
